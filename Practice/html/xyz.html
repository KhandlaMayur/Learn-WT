        <p>
            Hello! I'm Mahek Chotara, a final-year B.Tech student specializing in Information Technology.<br>

            I’m passionate about creating modern websites and applications. I enjoy working with front-end technologies
            like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I also have hands-on experience with back-end tools such as MySQL and
            Java.<br>

            Throughout my academic journey, I’ve completed coursework in Python, C++, and DBMS, and participated in
            several college-level projects. I have a strong interest in software development, UI/UX design, and
            continuously learning new technologies.<br>

            My goal is to become a full-stack developer and contribute to innovative and impactful tech solutions. I’m a
            dedicated, team-oriented individual who loves solving problems and taking on new challenges.
